# Compilers-and-Agda
I attend a course at ELTE about compilers and I try to formalize all the concepts we learn on the way in agda.

If this project is not finnished (or missing some pieces) by 2017.June, I probably got fed up with it, but feel free to drop me a line if you need anything extra!

In the different folders i try different aproaches to solving basicly the same problem.
