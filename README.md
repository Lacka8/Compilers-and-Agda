# RegEx-and-Agda

In the different folders I try different approaches to make elegant RegEx parsing in agda.

der: Derivate based: This is well formalized and written based on a paper:
http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~camarao/certified-parsing-regex.pdf

naive: Naive approach to finding all possible matches. Very ineffective and not well formalized

bt: Backtracking TODO

I'm sort of new to dependently typed programing so if you see any problems with my code, help is always apriciated! :)
